During a break from my studies in 2009 I took a three month internship with Bramberger architects of Graz, Austria which was then extended a further three months.

While working for Bramberger architects I assisted several experienced designers on a variety of projects &#8211; sometimes taking leadership of the detailing of aspects, sometimes completing drawings to instruction and often undertaking 3-dimensional modelling to assist design and for presentation to the planning authorities and clients.

Bramberger architects are an award winning practice with an international portfolio and a specialism in creating sensitive modern adaptations to historic buildings and elegant, original, contemporary work.

Below are some examples and a brief description of some of the projects I was involved with:

        Landstube
      </address>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Styrian Parliament hired Bramberger architects to remodel the furniture and oversee the restoration of the historic features in their chamber and also to completely redesign their bar/cafe and meeting room.  I completed a series of drawings for the bar/cafe and also for a seating platform used by the press and public who come to observe the parliament in session.  The seating platform was made more complicated by stipulations of the client.  The existing platform with cold stainless steel railings should be left intact and a new, easily removable skin should be layered on top.

    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <address>
        das bauwerk, Nikolaiplatz
      </address>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

das bauwerk is a contemporary office building inserted into the historic Nikolaiplatz.  The rational forms that set the character of the building took some clever detailing and service work.

Saubermacher, a multinational waste disposal company decided to centralise several dispersed offices in a new, purpose-built company headquarters.
