This bookshelf is designed for use in a kitchen, an office or a private library to store and display books or other items.  It is the perfect height for those who like to have a book open for inspiration or to work from while cooking or painting etc.  While in use as a book stand the moving shelf is down and light from the shelf above illuminates the task.  In the evening when there is no need to display a book the shelf is lifted up and light is diffused through the patterned apertures which cast atmospheric, dappled light across the room.

I left this project as a miniture for over a year but plan to make a prototype in early 2012.
