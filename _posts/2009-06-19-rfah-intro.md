It&#8217;s something like a travel journal, but something rather more. It&#8217;s about reaching out for something big and far away – Ulaanbaatar – and the effort, the bumps and the scrapes and the acts of heart-warming charity encountered along the way in some of the worlds most isolated locations.

Sure the North Pole is abstract and distant but you know where it is and also that you can’t go there any more you can the moon. But Ulaanbaatar is just 10,000 kilometers away and if you felt a little restless on your way home from the supermarket, your old family car tired of the same old route and desperate for adventure, there&#8217;s probably a lot less than you think stopping you driving there yourself. That, for me, is what the Mongol Rally is about and what my book is about.

And people love the idea &#8211; the romance and the accessibility of it. I visited my former Primary School before I left to talk about the trip I was planning.  The children responded with reams of drawings, which all possessed the same otherworldly quality; they didn’t know where I was heading either. All I had been able to tell them was East, deserts and mountains.

The book is true to that dream and it brings back for you some of the magic of its origins, the moments of discovery and also the trials and the disappointments too. It has received excellent reviews from readers, male and female aged 15-77. I also am most proud to say it has also proved of great interest to reluctant readers, which I myself once was. Please enjoy the preview, your comments are of interest.
