## 18<sup>th</sup> August, Altai

In the morning the boys took us back down to the central market. It was the Central Asian bazaar buzz again; people riding around on Russian motorbikes with carpets over their seats and shopping draped everywhere. Many of the drivers seemed to be wearing yellow building helmets in lieu of crash helmets. We later reasoned that the headwear indicated it was a taxi. Outside, people were lined up heckling, shoppers were getting in and out of badly repaired Ladas and Hyundai taxis. Rubbish was blown around or lay floating on pools of water that gathered in little muddy hollows.

Inside, we went to the central office and paid a few Tugriks to have a message read out over the tannoy. “Does anyone have a partload for a 2CV to Ulaanbaatar?” We had a brief look around the market which was fun but I was beginning to feel ill and Cheq’s eagerness was grating more than it really should have. He kept repeating phrases that echoed around in my head, calling everything Mongolian ‘traditional’ this and Mongolian ‘national’ that, be it the tacky, badly reproduced Chinese carpets or kitsch costume dress. A large plastic breast plate painted gold particularly comes to mind. Later on when we needed the toilet Cheq pointed to the floor, human faeces were littering the dusty side street, or as he called it, ‘the Mongolian national toilet.’

We loitered around for the day playing on computers, billiards and generally soaking up the rough ambience of the place. At about four o’clock some people who had heard our request over the tannoy came to pick up ‘Herby’, as Cheq called our rather sad looking car, from the ghur. We pushed the car up to the top of a bank and parked the flatbed at the bottom. We then pushed and heaved the car up some planks onto the back. It took about seven of us but we managed without incident. Feeling optimistic, we hoped we would have the back of the truck to ourselves and even be able to get in and out of the car and have a relaxing time, stretching, sun bathing and getting drunk. However we were to be disappointed. They drove off and arranged to meet us in a couple of hours.

We left the ghur and went off to meet the drivers who were late and we waited and waited. Eventually we decided to go for a meal. Cheq knew the owner of a little café. It was clean and it was friendly. We had two courses, one of pasta with salad and pork, and one of buuz (a Mongolian national dish rather like Chinese New Year or boiled dumplings). They were tasty but by the time Cheq asked for us to be brought the Mongolian national drink I had premonitions that I was about to get ill again. The national drink itself was refreshing. They soaked raisins and spices in water making a dilute infusion.

After we had rung them repeatedly and waited for the best part of an afternoon, the drivers, who were always ‘nearly there’, finally arrived. They were still far from ready to leave and had only come to calm us down. I demanded to go with them and for them to leave a driver with Jonno and the others. It may be worth mentioning at this point that our car had been so entirely buried that it could very well not have been there. Three ghurs and their corresponding contents had been thrown on and the load bulged out above the cab and over the sides. We were also told that we would be riding on the top of the load as the cab was full.

Having loaded the vehicle they needed to inflate the tyres to compensate for the extra weight. I went off with the team and left the others with one of the drivers. I was at first quite suspicious of them but I persevered. At the garage things were going without a hitch, if a little slowly, but as they inflated the front wheel it began to bulge threateningly. The smallest, smartest and most friendly driver got a knife from the glove box. The handle had snapped off so he had to hold the blade and handle together with his thumb in order to use its point. As he pushed the blade into the tyre to release the pressure, he caught the inner tube. The tyre exploded, my glasses flew off and everyone just looked around as if to check they were still alive. The driver was holding his injured shoulder with one hand and the empty knife handle in the other. We looked around for the blade. It had passed between the driver and myself, bounced off a car, whose door it had ripped a hole through, and landed on the far side of me, closely missing me twice. Choosing to laugh it off I gave the unfortunate driver a Kit-Kat to help him get over his shock.

By the time we had finished putting on a new (old) tyre it was getting dark. We drove back into town where Jonno and the other guys were waiting. Apparently we still were not ready to go. While the drivers repacked, we went for a walk up to a small shallow lake where a number of stout little Mongolian horses came to drink. It was to be the site of the town’s first hospital. The mayor and town officials were arranging the funding for the building but it looked as though construction might have been stalled for a while.

We also did a spot of wrestling. It was good fun and I did not let the Cumberland Wrestling tradition down, holding my own against both Cheq and Boris. Finally we were ready to go. There were about twelve girls on the back of the lorry, a couple of their mothers and one of the drivers. Jonno wanted to join them but as we had made such a fuss to be in the cab we stayed put. In the cab were three drivers, someone’s Gran, Jonno and myself. It was quite a sad goodbye. Cheq had been wonderfully kind, friendly and open and I instantly forgot any irritation his constant pattering had caused and felt grateful for his friendship. Boris was a really good guy too, intelligent, low-key and above all incredibly loyal. It would be great to see them both again.

However uncomfortable the ride, it was greatly relaxing to imagine that the whole exhilarating but exhausting adventure would all be over the following evening.
