Having completed my studies in Sheffield and secured a placement with architect <a title="Bramberger-architects" href="http://http://www.bramberger-architects.at" target="_blank">Alfred Bramberger</a> in Graz, Austria, I decided to travel out there in style &#8211; on my motorbike, a Suzuki 125 GN for anyone who is interested.  My route was to be sensitive to the landscape first riding out from Sheffield up the Don to the Humber and hence to Hull.  From Hull I took a boat to the Hook of Holland, near Rotterdam and hence down up the Rhine to Bregenz, Austria and from then on to Graz through though the Alpine passes.

On route I will sought out and wrote about my three most compelling passions; Landscape, Art and Architecture.  From the castles, towns and rivers that so moved J.W.M. Turner, to the works of Zumthor, Piano,  Ando and OMA.
