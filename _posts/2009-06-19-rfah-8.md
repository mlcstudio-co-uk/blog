## 3<sup>rd</sup> August, Tashkent – Samarqand

We continued tinkering and chatting with the mechanics until well after dark. In the meantime Bakhtiar had been home and returned with his girlfriend, Sylvia. She was a white Russian, blonde and very beautiful. Her English was also excellent so she acted as our translator. 

We said our goodbyes and followed Bakhtiar to an apartment that an old Russian babushka, a friend of Sylvia’s called Tanya, let for twenty dollars a night. The flat was Soviet built like so many others in so many other blocks in so many other cities. Built around a courtyard, with grass, trees and childrens’ toys, it was very comfortable with generous living room, kitchen and bath with hot water. It only had one bed, which I let Jonno take, as I chose not to share and did not like to make him take the sofa or floor on my account when he would have been happy to top and tail.

We parked the car in a gated yard where the caretaker lived which was probably not necessary but a comforting and a considerate idea. The caretaker was drinking with friends. Several times I returned to the car, for items I had forgotten or came to need, and on each occasion his greetings became increasingly dramatic. Vodka, familiarity and the will to communicate broke down the barriers and on the last occasion I commented how beautiful his garden was, for he was cultivating a great number of vegetables in his little compound. He was obviously very proud and took me on a tour, picking for me three handsome tomatoes and a cucumber. 

Jonno was desperate to make a daytrip to Samarqand but short of money and having seen nearly nothing of Tashkent I would have forgone such a rushed trip for a much needed rest and a little exploration closer to where we were.

Organising the trip took considerable effort. The train, which we had heard was excellent, was too expensive for our slim budget and besides which was fully booked. A taxi for the day including return journey was available for around ninety dollars. We all agreed this was cheap but it was still beyond our means. This put extra pressure on our hosts who found translation stressful and had to ring a number of different offices and relay the information, only for us to concede that we could not afford the price. Eventually we settled on a bus which was considerably cheaper but much longer and still required several taxi rides.

We bid a tired goodnight to our equally tired hosts and made use of the hot water and tucked down in anticipation of an exciting day.

As arranged only a few hours earlier, a taxi came to collect us at five in the morning. At the bus stop there were perhaps as many as fifty coaches at least half of them heading to Samarqand. Even at this time, hundreds of people were already milling around with huge bundles of wares, haggling on the price of transporting them. The outbound journey would be three hours and five hours back as it returned via a different route. We departed at around seven o’clock, once our bus was full and the hold was stuffed to overflowing with luggage and merchandise.

I must have slept most of the journey as I remember nothing of it but some way outside Samarqand the bus stopped and we transferred to a taxi. The driver overcharged us and then abandoned us in a wide, mercilessly hot, deserted square, overlooked by tall air conditioned buildings of concrete and glass. Our map was at a useless scale and we could not find the restaurant that our guide book suggested. Finally, with the help of a lovely, if not a little camp, Russian Uzbek, we found our courtyard restaurant. It was certainly worthy of the recommendation. Yellow stone outside and painted brilliant white inside, it was shady and cool. I had the distinct feeling I might have been transported to India, Arabia or back in time and in a sense I had but it was simply the authentic charm indigenous to Samarqand. It was both elegant and refined. 

The dining was mainly around a courtyard. We shared a plate of Plov, the traditional Uzbek banquet fare. A rice dish generally made with oil, milk, sultanas and all manner of rich ingredients; there are hundreds of different varieties. We had Samarqand Plov on the bone, a delicious but perhaps ambitiously rich meal. We were later advised to drink only tea with our food and not to drink much liquid, particularly cold water. The cold water mixes with the oily food and makes it impossible to digest.

Anyhow, and perhaps as a result of something we had eaten the previous day, we were both feeling progressively ill. After the meal we headed to the Registan &#8211; the old centre of Samarqand which had been the site of various different Islamic schools or madrassa. It had previously been a commercial centre or market and a place of justice/public execution. Said to be similar in style to the Taj Mahal, the Registan was built by architects of the same tradition &#8211; the Mughal Empire having been founded by Barbur, a descendant of Tamerlane.

Many argue that its format, bringing commercial, judicial, governmental and religious centres together in one place, has a common ancestry with some of Europe’s great renaissance cities, most obviously Venice. Their forebears were the great Iranian centres that flourished some time after Islam was introduced by Arabic conquests of the seventh century. However, the Registan has its own innovations and charms having been variously known as the “Eden of the Ancient East”, “Precious Pearl of Islam” and “The Gem of the East”.

During its golden age, in the fifteenth century, Samarqand was one of the leading centres of learning in the world. The great Ulugbek, who lends his name to the oldest madrassa in the Registan, was a generous patron of students and an able scholar himself. He even taught in his madrassa.

Ulugbek was Tamerlane’s grandson, a moderate man of letters and learning. From Samarqand he had ruled the northern marches of the Timurid Empire and presided over a luminary and cultured court. The ruling class considered him too weak and lacking in diplomacy. Ultimately he was accused and not without foundation, of neglecting his borders, and causing unnecessary offence to his nobles. Ulugbek met his unfortunate end in 1449 at the hand of a mercenary hired by his son and the empire followed soon after. 

However, perhaps the most famous feature of the Registan is several hundred years newer and found above the cavernous portal or Iwan of the Sher-Dor Madrassa, the eastern member of the ensemble.1 

The Sher-Dor’s façade is boldly decorated with inscriptions, scrolling, geometric patterns and weaving stems blossoming white and gold blooms over a dark blue background. But this rather orthodox arrangement is crowned by a remarkably pagan frieze. It boasts the flattened symmetrical forms of two very tiger-like lions. Each lion is bearing a sun with a human face on his back, apparently watching the lion hunt young deer. Understandably, much is made of its departure from the Islamic law, prohibiting any depiction of animate life.

All around, the patterned tile work is every bit as spectacular as the reports suggest. Incredibly rich and varied, the finest to be found on the Ulugbek Madrassa. The forms of the onion domes are bulging and breathtaking to this day, screaming water, abundance and daring power to the surrounding deserts.

Unfortunately our visit was badly timed. Hundreds of police or military guards swarmed around the site, making preparations for a grand national spectacle to be hosted there the following weekend. The buildings were also being hastily repaired, tiles replaced and minarets hung with scaffolding. So in addition to the pedlars who you can rely on finding around all such sites, the extra officials and workmen made it very difficult to explore and lose yourself in the experience. Traders were operating in all of the cells of the Ulugbek Madrassa which in its day would have housed some of the worlds leading scholars of the Qur’an and also the secular sciences. Now their walls were entirely lined with identical products, almost exclusively made in China. Perhaps, in that at least, there was some continuity. 

I was disappointed by the lack of historic information and all the distractions which made it near impossible to imagine how the buildings had once been used. The restoration work carried out by the USSR and even now under the protection of UNESCO is similarly fraught. If they were to do nothing one can be certain that eventually everything would crumble and disappear. Yet, even as they replace and repair, the steady loss and decay of that most precious spirit, the evidence of a distant life, continues.

Such large monuments often suffer thus, too tied to grand gestures of the state who built them and those who subsequently use and preserve them to possess a truly human aspect. They must remain a little alienating, dizzying, almost unjustifiable, commitments of energy. Understanding this is part of the contract you make with a place and for this reason I prefer visiting works of a more intimate scale that are more private and emotional affairs. 

And in fact I had come to Samarqand mainly in the hope of a visit to Ulugbek’s observatory and the mausoleum complex where many of the city’s ancient notables are buried. Although they lie only a short taxi ride from the centre of town I began to realise that I would not make it, at least this time, and slouched against a wall holding my cramping stomach. The travelling had taken too long and as I fell ill I started to faint and was unable to stand or move for more than a few hundred metres at a time. It remains the greatest regret of my trip that I missed a visit to the mausoleums.

The mausoleum complex is a maze of tombs, many with connected ancillary buildings, small mosques and madrassa. This socially minded practice of providing space for study and worship inside or adjacent to a tomb was a common practice in monumental burials of the various Turkic, Arabic and Iranian empires that held sway in the region. And they serve to preserve some sense of the fantastic wealth and often progressive governance, art, science and learning that flourished there in those years before the steady decline of the silk route. A decline heralded by Vasco de Gamma’s navigation of the Cape of Good Hope and the subsequent rise of European colonialism and naval power. 

By three o’clock I had surrendered, suffering from waves of stomach cramps I tried to find shelter at the edge of the Registan but the guards who were preparing the arena for some spectacular show moved me on. Eventually a kind shop owner allowed me a corner of his porch where I lay and waited for Jonno. I was by then a miserable wretch, dwelling on the experiences lying just beyond my reach. When he had seen enough Jonno found me in the shop and he, also feeling ill, agreed to take a taxi back. The shop owner again proved his good spirit, trekking out to the taxi rank at the edge of town with us and arranging our transport back to Tashkent.  
It was slightly more expensive than the bus but mercifully half the journey time. We arrived back in Tashkent very late anyway. There were further complications with our address being incomplete. The landlady, Tanya had to come and meet us. Tanya was very sweet and did the best job she could to mother us. It was to be a very uncomfortable night all the same.
