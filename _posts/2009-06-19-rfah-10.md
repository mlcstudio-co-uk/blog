## 8<sup>th</sup> August, Kazakhstan

Our new convoy did not last for long. We broke up soon after the Kazakh border control. Impatient with each other’s stops, we finally separated in the heavy traffic of Alma Ata, Kazakhstan’s largest and probably most beautiful city. 

Alma Ata seemed prosperous, it was busy and, despite being midday, it was cool on account of the shade provided by the numerous trees which lined the streets. It was a shame not to explore but we had no time to lose and a whole day’s drive ahead. In a particularly Kazakh gesture of kindness, while stuck in traffic, a trucker passed Jonno a can of Pepsi down from his cab. He was perhaps embarrassed not to have been able to give us a watermelon. It was a different Kazakhstan to the one we had travelled through on the Aral road. The journey north was also beautiful. Although nothing approaching as mountainous as Kyrgyzstan, the way was punctuated by several low-level ranges, lakes and holiday resorts. Feeling optimistic Jonno reasoned we could be out of Kazakhstan in a day and into Mongolia in another. Semipalatinsk was a good 1000km and Mongolia a further 1000km.

In an attempt to make progress and to beat my chronic inability to digest a proper meal, we stocked up on crisps and chocolate. “Do you want white or brown Smak, Jonno?” Polish snack food was universally available throughout Central Asia, apparently taking preference over passable Russian and awful Chinese alternatives. ‘Smak’, of both white and brown varieties, was available well into Mongolia and children, mothers and truckers could all be seen dipping their hands into a bag. Rather like a cross between Pringles and Monster-Munch, reconstituted and heavily salted, this flavoured pulp was the order of the day.

While making time, driving at night, Jonno hit a pothole. It was a big smash. The inside of the rim was deformed. It looked like a write off. Citroën 2CV wheels are tubeless; consequently, when the rim and the tyre lose contact, air escapes. This kind of damage is common when ‘off roading’ and all the mechanics and tyre shops are used to truing up wheels. Our second spare went soon after. I was able to adjust this one with our slightly two ounce hammer although it was still audibly losing air.

Then it was my turn to do some night driving. Jonno was asleep when we came to a fork in the road. I reversed back a hundred metres, climbed out of the car as quietly as I could and ran off towards a café. A trucker was just pulling in so I waved him down and asked, “Strasvoitier, Semipalitinsk, nelyevo – nepravo?” Although a little inconclusive, I got the idea he said, “preyamo”, straight ahead, and pointed left. Back at the fork in the road I took the left. Soon after another road joined from my right. I did not get a chance to ponder on this as a policeman jumped out waving an illuminated orange baton at me. He explained the mysterious fork was actually a triangularabout and should be navigated by taking the right hand fork. Thus enlightened, and fortunately avoiding a fine, we headed on.

We may have paused for a nominal rest but the next memory was stopping at breakfast time the following day. Jonno spotted a Rally car parked outside a café so we went in to have a chat with the owners. They were team ‘Nissan2do’ – Ram and Hywel. Hywel managed a company that made batteries and also organised sound systems for the entertainment of a king somewhere in the Far East. Ram ran the local corner shop near Hywel’s London residence and he was the owner of the team’s formidable Nissan. The Nissan Sunny had been Ram’s family car for sixteen years and he appeared wonderfully unsentimental about the vehicle. The pair thrashed the Sunny at speeds of around 100mph up roads littered with paddling pool size craters.

We agreed to travel together and stop in the next town to buy supplies and fix the cars. The Sunny had developed exhaust problems similar to those we had acquired in western Kazakhstan. We tried several mechanics before we found one with a welder, needed to fix the Sunny. They quickly sorted our less damaged wheel but said there was little point trying to repair the more damaged rim. We pushed him to try. It took a huge amount of hammering, sweat and glue but by the time he had finished, the leak seemed to have stopped.

Team ‘Nissan2do’ were still trying to dismantle their exhaust so I turned my attention to the points in our car which I had been told might need adjusting in hotter climes and I was concerned about how our engine was firing. In Alma Ata when the sun had been beating down and the traffic flow stagnated, the engine started jumping and backfiring and we had to ride the clutch to get enough power to move.

While borrowing a tool from Hywel to remove the fan that covers the points, I enlisted his help. He set the timing at a ridiculous angle in the anti-clockwise position. It now only fired on one cylinder. He tinkered around a little, increasing or reducing the angle of adjustment until it appeared to run smoothly. I then opened the points box to adjust the separation of the contacts, increasing the distance to the thickness of a piece of paper folded in two. I tightened the screw, which secured the separation of the points adequately and was just about to close the box when I thought, ‘for good measure’, I would put another half a turn on the screw. A silly idea. The box is aluminium like most of the engine and I pulled out half the threads. In a state of panic I tried to think of patch ups. Thread lock, re-threading the hole, Araldite. After an hour of anxiety Ram, calm and keen to help, came to my aid. He suggested wrapping the screw in cotton thread. He showed me how to unwind some from a length of string saying this was a standard trick in India where his family own a farm.

Much relieved we put the car back together, paid the garage hands and went to get some fuel and have lunch. We got to the petrol station without event. Perhaps the car was making a little more noise than before but it was pulling like normal. Then we lost power all together. Not able to get to 20km per hour we pulled in under some shade. To make matters worse we realised my camera had disappeared while we were at the garage.  
Ram and Hywel had some lunch with us but said that they must head on. A little disappointed we said goodbye. Returning to the garage to ask for our camera was as futile as we had guessed it would be.

Very dejected we decided to make for Russia and a mechanic we felt we could trust. But by the limits of that awful nameless town it became apparent that we were in no position to carry on. Jonno was in the worst of moods; rightly blaming me for tinkering when it was not absolutely necessary. Confident the trouble was only minor I went to recruit the help of a family who were picnicking near by. A father and son introduced themselves as Serge and Alexei. Serge, the father had one leg up on a rock, cutting slithers out of a watermelon with a gigantic hunting knife. Alexei, was probably a little younger than Jonno and I and was slight and agile. The mother emerged from the SUV and looked very sympathetic. They gave me some melon and told me to invite Jonno. 

Later Jonno was to say, “You just broke our car, in the middle of Kazakhstan, we don’t have a phone coz it was nicked in a town like this and now we don’t even have a camera. And there’s you wandering off to chat with some bloody Russian family and you ask me if I want some watermelon – make you feel better Jonno &#8211; no it won’t and I f\***ing hate watermelon anyway.”

It worked for me though. The family were really sweet and cheered me up. It was impossible for us to go back to the first garage where our camera had disappeared and we had been humiliated. The family gave us a tow back to a warehouse on the edge of the town. A few friendly looking guys were sitting around drinking vodka from pudding bowls.

I knew I could fix the car if I could get the fan off, something you needed an extra small socket set for. Team ‘Nissan2do’ had gone with theirs so we were stuck. I did my best to explain my needs to one of the guys and he managed to find the right socket in the boot of his old Lada but we also needed an extension and driver for it. I followed him into the warehouse. It was huge but poignantly empty, more empty and more dusty than rundown. They only had a minimum of tools in a state of complete disarray.

Although I had not given up hope on the garage workers, I was enormously happy to see ‘The Payne Train’ pulling in to our aid. We had left them the previous day and not on fantastically good terms. Sam was actually really friendly. I had spoken to him on the launch day and also a little at the meal and found him a good natured chap. He offered us his socket set, bought especially with 2CV fans in mind. Within a few minutes I had the fan off and the points stripped back down again. It took a little longer to build a strobe light from one of our indicators and find a welding rod to jam the fly-wheel.

With everything prepared and a few pointers from the Haynes Manual, I quickly reset the timing. ‘The Payne Train’ had been anxious to get going again but relaxed a bit when some friends of theirs arrived. The team, whose name I forget, had opted for an extra off road section, just for the fun of it. They had had some near misses, but they seemed to have revelled in the audacity of it.

Jonno was a little more relaxed now but still a bit tense. He was helping out and could see how things were going. When everything was set we excitedly rebuilt the car and it started first time. Jonno raced off at top speed and disappeared down the road, whooping and letting go his tensions. It was a marvellous sight to see our Amélie back from the brink and as good as ever. All we needed to do now was find Sam’s socket. I was looking up and down the yard for it. Sam was getting anxious but neither of us could see it. Chris said tersely, “Have you looked under the tool box?” Ludicrously, we had not. Much relieved and not a little embarrassed, we found it there. 

With deepest gratitude we let ‘The Payne Train’ carry on and left soon after. We had driven right through the night again and got no further for our agonies than the well-rested Payne team. However, we were on for another late night making up for lost time.

Jonno drove a good way towards Semipalatinsk before swapping for a sleep. We were about to enter the city when I decided to stop and have a coffee and a packet of biscuits. This truck stop was certainly one of the best yet. Like so many, of single storey concrete construction, its simple façade punctured with windows, it appeared almost black, silhouetted against the cold blue night sky. Welcome and hospitality escaped the place like the slit of warm orange light between the curtains. I ducked a moth that circled a flickering yellow light, pushed aside the fly screen and entered. The atmosphere was heavy and respectful as if the cafeteria served some spiritual purpose. The greasy, plastic, wipe clean table cloths puckered into irregular patterned ridges and sparkled in the light of a low watt bulb. I can be certain that everyone present was suffering, just like me, from chronic sleep deprivation. The syrupy ‘MacCoffie™’ they served was of ritual significance to the truckers during their rest time. I was reluctant to sit but felt stern pressure from the other guests to respect the rest time and take my seat. The biscuits were like custard creams only with a banana flavoured paste.

I got most of the way through Semipalatinsk without waking Jonno but decided to pull in and check the tyre pressures before crossing a bridge out of the city. The front right one, which had been saved from write off earlier that day, was quite low. At first I tried to use an automatic refill can that we had been given at the Rally launch. In theory it should have injected foam into the tyre, sealed any holes and continued to inflate it for me quite effortlessly. Instead, I found the results were intensely frustrating. Furious and still covered in sticky, toxic smelling slime, three youths approached, drunk and instantly tedious. Fortunately, I had inflated the tyre by hand before the insults they were reciting from Hollywood films convinced me to test the feeling that I had, in fact, become invincible.

Jonno told me off for being rude to them and we drove on a little way, stopping 20km short of the border. Making camp by the side of the road and setting the alarm for seven o’clock I allowed myself a little self-pity and a moment’s despair before settling down for the five hours we had scheduled for sleep. This was woefully inadequate, having been driving continuously for two days with no break to rest but we had little choice other than to bed down and make the best of it. 

In the past few days the only sleep either of us had managed was as a passenger being bounced around with nothing on which to rest our heads or stolen at the wheel. It was scary to think how often I had been alternating which eye to look through and found both eyes closed and my head slump for a second. The temptation to not force yourself back into consciousness in these circumstances is seductive to say the least. Short breaks only alleviated the condition for about half an hour and, given the great distances we had to travel, we were forced to just persevere. Jonno admitted to driving in this state most of the time we had been on our forty hour race to Tashkent.
