## 16<sup>th</sup> August, Altai

We were woken early by a Transsyberian Rally official. Even so, most of the camp had already packed up and left. The official had come to recover the tent that had been given to Jonno the previous night. The crew were clearly not happy with our arrival or continued presence and were keen to move us on. I gave myself a shake and gazed around but the mountains were still obscured by morning mist. After a quick word with Jonno I went about seeking passage on a truck to Ulaanbaatar for our broken car. I directed my first enquiry to the Mongolian man in charge of logistics. He was extremely dismissive. Perhaps word had preceded us that we had favoured the Swiss over the Mongolian engineers, a choice which had taken its toll on the car.

“How much do you think that would cost?” he asked.  
Having no experience of such things I replied, “I don’t really know.”  
“We just arranged to have one of our cars moved for $20,000.”

I was shocked. This was a ridiculous sum and one that might have transformed the lives of a lucky family. However, the man was obviously very unhappy and even if he had paid ten times over the odds it was clear that we could not afford it. I went to tell Jonno and begged for him to let us abandon it there and then and just get to the finish line as painlessly as possible. Jonno, as always, was convinced he could get it a little cheaper and he didn’t care if it was going to hurt. 

A young pair, Cheq and Boris, who were related to the kitchen staff wanted us to go back to their house in nearby Altai. A man who had been walking around scratching his gigantic bare belly agreed to make a quick buck and towed us to town. We were dropped off near the outskirts and together with our new friends, Cheq and Boris, we pushed the car to their ghur. 

They had been helping out at the base camp, earning a little money and getting some much loved Transsyberian Rally branded hats and jackets. I could imagine the town transposed to Alaska, Svalbard or nearly anywhere in the Arctic Circle &#8211; quite remarkable considering Altai is some way south of Lizard Point, the most southerly tip of England. God bless the Gulf Stream. Hundreds of identical little yards backed onto each other, all surrounded by identical wooden fences, all about eight feet high. Inside most were a pair of mucky white ghurs on a bare bit of hard orange dirt. Cheq was staying with his older brother, Chaggana, who was around thirty and married with two children. The in-laws had a ghur in the same yard but they all seemed to eat and sleep in the one tent.

The family was wonderful. They greeted us and we washed our hands at the outside sink, a contraption which seemed common throughout Central Asia. We went inside and tried to overcome the obvious language barrier. Cheq was confident with his English but at times talked a little too much. Chaggana couldn’t say a word, he just grinned and we agreed he was one of the kindest, most genuine people either of us had ever met. His wife was also sweet, always cooking &#8211; she would make four cooked meals a day. Mostly we would eat rice and occasionally pasta, cooked in a sheep bone broth. The sparse meat, tendons and membranes would be stripped off with a knife and eaten whole. The bones went to the dog and the grease you rubbed into your hands to protect them from the chapping winds.

I spent a long time watching Cheq’s uncle. He was wizened and fascinatingly old. He wore the traditional heavy belted gown and a cowboy hat. Every few minutes he would pull a pipe up from one of his long leather boots. It was kept inside a beautiful hand made pouch and he would lie this on his lap while he pulled out his embroidered tobacco bag. This was made so one half could be tucked behind the belt and the other half hang over. In this way the fine embroidery could be displayed and was also accessible whilst on horse back. The opening was in the middle of the bag, along the inside fold so nothing could fall out of it. You could tell this man was passionate about his hobby every time he ceremoniously emptied his pipe into a metal cup attached to his tobacco bag with several elegant little taps.

Boris seemed to be forever buoyant. Handsome in a strange looking way, his strength, loyalty and honesty were clear to all. He had a ready grin and like his uncle, he really enjoyed a good smoke, but for Boris it was all about ‘ready-mades’. Boris’ mother was headmistress of the local school but he had been away studying engineering in Ulaanbaatar for a few years.

Once in their care they insisted we eat, sleep and relax. After our second cooked meal we went for a walk into town. Our first call was the central market. If you have ever been to a poor man’s market, maybe even in your home town, you will know the light takes on a sharper, whiter quality and be able to recall the trashiness, the excess of bright colours, the distance and the ferocity of it all. 

That evening we went en famile to a party in the central square. The whole town was there. We met Boris’ mother who was short and stocky, a kind but formidable woman. She had a fitting stature for her role as head teacher at the school. A string of quite average acts was followed by Mongolia’s favourite rock band. The charm of it quite overtook us and we couldn’t believe our luck. However, there was a slightly rough side to the night. Cheq was having trouble with a school mate and a fight broke out. Boris was in there double-quick. They seemed to settle things by grabbing each other’s collars and gnashing their teeth. I got a hand around Cheq and was almost carried away but Jonno pulled me out of harms way.  
When we got back we had a round of freshly made pasta and boiled bones. Cheq’s sister-in-law amazed me by making fresh pasta, at one o’clock in the morning from a chopping board on her knee.

Then we had a round of arm wrestling. To start with it was Jonno vs. Mongolia, then Boris had a go with Chaggana. I got involved a little late but surprised myself, faring rather well, although it was against opponents who had just given it their all.

The highlight of the night came after we had eaten and settled down. Chaggana sang us a Mongolian long song. Long songs usually only have about ten words although they are sounded over a period of several minutes. We were to hear the long song of the lonely eagle. It was both spell binding and majestic.

Jonno had a habit of waking in the middle of the night and being very disorientated and, for a moment, quite scared. I had learned to agree in some nonsense way to whatever nonsense he had begun talking about and send him back to sleep. But when Jonno woke this night Chaggana heard him and, not being able to reassure him with English and not wanting anyone else to wake, got up and rummaged around for a candle, lit it and brought it over for him and got back to bed. Jonno tells this story with half a tear in his eye &#8211; he was a special man.
