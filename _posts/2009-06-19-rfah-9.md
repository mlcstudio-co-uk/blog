## 5th August, Uzbekistan – Kyrgyzstan

The Ferghana Valley is by far the most populated region of Central Asia. Towards the upper reaches of the Syr Darya, the Jaxartes, twin of the river Amu Darya or Oxus, the Ferghana Valley is lush, fertile and productive. A valuable possession of various earlier empires including the Khanate of Khokand, the Karakhanids and the USSR, this area has the potential to be an affluent and independent province. However, Stalin, in a deliberate move to sabotage the region, divided it up along impossibly complicated boundaries. For better or for worse, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are all interlocked, breaking lines of communication and generally stifling chances of unification and independence in the region.

We drove for hours without finding a place either uncultivated or built upon. Transfer into Kyrgyzstan was relatively painless, perhaps eased by Jonno giving his Leather-Man multi-tool, to an official. The guards were all chewing curious little balls of tobacco which looked like pellets of hashish or opium. We noted little change crossing between the two countries although the atmosphere seemed considerably calmer in Kyrgyzstan. More people were cycling and there were fewer Daewoos, or new cars in general.

We passed through Osh, taking a wrong turn which led us miles through the village-like suburbs. Many young people were walking around, chatting and enjoying themselves. As the evening progressed, we noticed more and more night clubs opening. They looked fun and uncomplicated with lots of bright coloured lights. The Kyrghiz seemed like a good bunch and we were enjoying the drive. However, as the state of the road deteriorated, it became apparent we were not on the road to Jalal-Abad. We had gone a surprisingly long way off course but quickly retraced our steps to Osh and the main road.

After several more hours we began to climb towards Ozgon and found the first stretch of land in miles neither cultivated nor built upon. We stopped for the night by the side of the road at the entrance to a large farm. Jonno spoke to the owners during the night. They had woken him to move the car over but were very friendly and did not ask us to leave. They were returning home but in no time were back into town to continue drinking. We saw them coming home again, looking very merry, at around seven in the morning when we were making ready to leave.

Monday 6th, we soon decided that driving in Kyrgyzstan would be great fun. The conditions were perfect; it was very sunny and not too hot. Just before Ozgon we stopped by the statue of an unknown rider who presided over the most fantastic view. The valley we were climbing out of was wide and flat bottomed. The whole width was broken with pools of standing water and plaited streams meeting and parting, pocketed with islands of intense green foliage, all banked by the majestic, tawny-grey, scree-covered mountains. So perfect was the vista, the climate and the air, it was an effort to leave.

Later in the day we stopped to talk to a couple of cyclists, Gal and Rami from Israel, who had already been travelling for over a year. They had cycled from Bangkok, through China and Central Asia and Afghanistan. When we met them they were en route to Jalal-Abad, a Kyrghiz provincial capital, to get an Uzbek visa.

It came into conversation that as Israelis they would never be allowed into Pakistan, something for which I felt a strange sympathy. If one considers all the liberties withheld from people around the world, and particularly the well-documented trials of the Jewish people and of the Palestinians, this comparatively minor restriction is hardly worthy of comment. However, as a great lover of high mountains, history and the fantastic mountain people of Asia, to me it seemed a very severe penalty to be denied the right to travel up the Indus, to see Mt. Chilas from the Karakorum highway and to glimpse the legendary view down the Kyber Pass.

A little further down the road we were stopped by two Rally teams, which was very exciting as we had not met any fellow ralliers since we said farewell to the Austrians. They were checking whether we had broken down, having seen us stopped talking to the cyclists. They were able to travel at a phenomenal 100mph in their relatively modern Nissan Micras. Although within minutes a mere speck on the horizon, we hoped to meet up later for a camp and supper. Climbing up through the mountains was a highlight of the trip. The reluctance to ever leave this most pristine of locations was greater than ever and I made a hundred private promises to return, to linger long enough to overcome the distance our speed created between us and the land. The roads were well-kept and weaved up through sandy cliffs, watered with fresh springs and made beautiful by the strong summer sun. 

We finished our ascent and came to a sunflower pasture on the mountain top before dropping down into another valley which held near its head the sizable Toktogul Reservoir.

We decided to continue driving until we found the other Rally cars but despite searching in every village, we did not find them. Eventually we had driven all the way round the reservoir and had given up on meeting the other teams. We drove several miles down a gravel track into a field that we soon recognised to be vegetated entirely with wild hemp. Coming fully into bud, there were acres of the stuff, hanging out of our grill, wedged in the doors and stuck under the window wipers. It was everywhere. We found a place to stop near the reservoir and made ready to camp, deciding it was best to wait until the morning for a swim.

The morning swim was delightful. Surrounded by mountains the water was crystal clear and hopping with fish. Driving back to the road we realised how far we had come. The locals looked very surprised to see us. Our car did gain us attention wherever we went but we had never experienced so many bewildered people, awestruck even. Many youngsters either ran away or cycled after us grinning. Birds of an exotic variety were swooping around the car, acting a little like swallows only their bodies were black and white, their heads topped with a Mohican head dress of vivid yellow.

Tuesday 7th was to be a challenging day for the car, crossing two great passes of 3330m and 3586m before descending into the capital city, Bishkek. In many places along the way the locals were selling Stok (honey) by the roadside. Possessing a beautiful flavour, it was sweet, waxy and with a harmonious quality blended from the nectars of a thousand wild mountain flowers. We stopped to buy some from a group of boys, one of whom was still dressed up in a beekeeper’s suit. When they had seen us slowing they charged excitedly down the road towards us. 

We exchanged greetings and I offered them a taste of my mother’s strawberry jam and some of Saf’s marmalade. One boy, who was a particularly good English speaker, poured me a bottle of honey, fresh from the hive and still containing a few unfortunate bees. They also gave us a taste of some delicious wild raspberries they had been collecting. I was very reluctant to leave but we still had a long way to go.

The first pass was very long. Going about the same speed as the huge Soviet era Kamaz trucks it was hard work for our 606cc Citroën CV Dolly. Over the watershed, we descended slowly through a gently sloping upland pasture. It was getting increasingly wild, wet and windy. I did not envy the many people and livestock dotted along this high plateau. The herders were feeding their animals on summer pastures but it was coming to the end of the season and they had no settled accommodation, only the traditional ghur for shelter. The weather was becoming increasingly charged and we were thrown around. Buffeted by thick draughts of air, saturated with small particles of hail and rain; it felt very rough, like we were afloat a stormy sea which threatened to engulf us.

Ghurs (also known as yurts) are a form of tent used commonly throughout Central Asia to this day. Composed of a latticed wooden drum, spanned by roof poles and traditionally covered in yak (bison) felt, the modern version is sometimes covered only with canvas. In the centre, the roof poles rest on an ornamental oculus which is supported by two columns, both of which are often painted in bright colours, as is the door, its frame and much of the furniture. It is under this opening that a fire is lit or the stove placed. 

The felt was traditionally made by laying a thick bed of un-spun wool on a pre-existing sheet of felt. Together they would be wrapped around a tree trunk and bound. The whole would then be dragged around the plateau by several horses until the loose wool had matted into felt. Mobile, well-insulated and social, the ghur is still the accommodation of choice for many.

After another small climb we came through our second pass. As we were navigating an exceptionally long, unlit, tunnel, which cut off the top of the pass, we saw a pair of horsemen galloping up the hill towards us. Once we broke through to the north side we were stunned by the light. Blinding white gradually gave way to a view down the steepest valley I have ever seen. The descent from Tor Ashuu to Kara Balta must rival any. The road led down very sharply, through a few hairpin bends and in no time we were on the valley bottom walled in by the near vertical valley sides.

It was over disappointingly quickly and we arrived in Bishkek sometime in the early evening. While Jonno was off changing money, a convoy of Rally cars arrived. They were fellow 2CV drivers, ‘The Payne Train’, ‘The Chariots of Rust’ and ‘Super Savs’. Not surprisingly, it did not take long for people to notice the four Rally cars parked together. There were many locals asking questions about our trip, all were shocked and amazed. AJ, an American speaker and chef on an American military base offered to take us to an apartment and out for a meal.

Used to providing this service for American personnel, AJ knew the drill. The apartment building was a tenement block and, like much of the city, communist-built. Although quite expensive we had plenty of space and a bathroom. AJ then picked all eight of us up and we squeezed into his old Kazakh Audi. It was a struggle but we all got in. Filing out, all through one door, it must have looked a little strange. Still unwell and somewhat off food I was not too interested in the rare offer of a burger and chips but it was good to chat to the other teams.

Chris, of ‘The Payne Train’, was taking notes and handing out questionnaires. He explained that he was doing his dissertation on the event. Dave, of ‘The Chariots of Rust’, was hoping to get to Tibet, an interest of his since boyhood. Having left school at sixteen and gone into apprenticeship with an engineering firm, Dave, every bit as intelligent as his student friends, had become much more settled. Aware of this he had recently sold his house in order to free up some money for a trip to the Himalaya.

After a few group photographs it was everyone back into the Audi. We were soon returned to our apartment where we gathered outside to thank AJ and wrap the evening up when he rather spoiled the moment by asking for some money &#8211; an unfortunate end to the night. Given the generosity and openness everyone else had shown, this left a bitter taste. He would probably have taken a cut from the accommodation fee and he had already had a free meal and drinks. Some people reluctantly paid the fee. I did not have any money and Jonno was adamant he would not pay. I did not think it was too objectionable, it was one of his regular sources of income and he had helped us out. His mistake was that he did not make the distinction between U.S. servicemen and British students travelling on very little besides good faith.
