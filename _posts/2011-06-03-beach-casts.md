This series of wall hanging sculptures in lead responds to my interest in the interaction of interplanetary energies and chemical elements.  By casting the ephemeral forms of the ripples, or striations, found in sandy beaches I am recording impressions of the combined effect of water, the sun, the wind and, most importantly, the moon on the transient surface of our planet.

These casts were taken from the beach at Allonby in West Cumbria.

I have also started experimenting with much larger forms in resin.
