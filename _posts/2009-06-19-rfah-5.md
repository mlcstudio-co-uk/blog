## 27<sup>th</sup> July, Russia – Kazakhstan

Friday 27th, our first full day on Russian tarmac, we left Kursk and headed towards Saratov, on the Volga. Having driven until very late the previous few days, we took the opportunity to park up before nightfall. 

Similar to the Ukraine, huge arable fields extended as far as the eye could see. On both sides of the road long lines of windbreaking trees and rough tracks divided the plain. We pulled off the road, down one such farm track and, when we had found a quiet spot with a row of trees to our back and a couple of fields between us and the road, we set up camp. 

We soon found that we had settled in a far from tranquil place. A dozen combine harvesters came dustily trundling past. One driver pulled to a stop, climbed down from his cab and approached us, bouncing along on his tip-toes, his trousers tucked into his socks. He was young and slight, with the reactions and physique of a boxer. He gestured for a cigarette with mad intensity in his eyes, his muscles tight as if working on pure reflex. Unfortunately we had to inform him we could not help. After politely nodding he calmly got back in his cab and gasped off in search of a cigarette. Shortly after, the landlord pulled up in his Soviet Uaz 4&#215;4, the best example we had seen yet. Far from trying to move us on, he took some pictures with a camera he had brought and offered us a shed a little further down the track which had a water tap. We declined politely and shared a toast, after which things did quieten down a little.

After a fantastic camp supper, cooked with ingredients fresh from a roadside stall, we set to work mending our long suffering Amélie. Jonno and Herwig fixed the exhaust system, which was leaking at the joints nearest the engine. Jacob and I had a go at the windscreen wipers which had stopped working, again during a thunderstorm. It was a fun evening and much improved by a tot or two of whisky, courtesy of one of Herwig’s sponsors.

Despite the presence of the still half full and rather tempting whisky bottle we decided to take the rare opportunity of an early night. Nevertheless, sooner than it was welcome, the sun announced it was time to rise. 

It was Saturday 28th, a week into the Rally and we had begun to settle into it. We had quickly learned the Cyrillic alphabet, while navigating and reading road signs, and the weather was gorgeous. Herwig and Jacob proved excellent company, relieving Jonno and I of our sense of confinement and graciously taking responsibilty for the navigating and pace setting. 

We left our camp before eating and after a short drive we stopped for breakfast at a café. The waitress was in good humour and enjoyed the surprise arrival of four young gents. Our conduct must have appeared courtly when compared to the scene we were about to witness. Enter two Russians, one tall and cruelly shaped, the other short, bald, moustachioed and cannonball-round. The shorter man looked straight through us and he wobbled a little as he was directed to a seat. He managed to eat his borsch but decided his mashed potato topped pork looked far better for sleeping on than eating. The tall man pulled his friend out of his half eaten breakfast and began dealing the sleeper’s shaven head a series of jaw shaking, open handed clouts.

Despite the physical encouragement, the stupor deepened. Flushed with embarrassment and probably outside the law, the companion watched in dismay as his friend slumped to the floor as softly and as gracelessly as a lump of dough. Having no hope of scraping his friend off the tiles alone, Jonno pushed me to the aid of the taller man. First we got him sitting upright and then we took an arm each, lifting him with a squat. Directing his substantial mass over to the van was easy enough, but getting him inside it was beyond our powers. Again the blows started raining in; several huge kicks to the rump roused little interest in the contented sleeper. However, a knock-out punch to the back of the head, in cartoon style, brought him to his senses. As quickly as they had arrived, they disappeared in a cloud of dust.

And on with the day we went too. We covered a good few miles and had a quick, simple lunch. At dusk we found the sorriest roadside bunkhouse yet but it was not without charm and at least it looked warm and safe. The surrounding terrain felt threatening, flat and barren with nothing to offer shelter. Not far away, a factory dealing with some mined material was busy pumping out a pall of dusty smoke with a terrific stink. At the door of the Inn it felt as though we had arrived at some Wild West themepark, badly reconstructed by an amateur enthusiast. Certainly it had never seen a craftsman but I decided to hold my tongue when I saw the owner, a short but physically impressive man, dressed in a tight, blue-grey camouflage T-shirt tucked into fatigues. He greeted us with a gold toothed smile, gun on his hip, keeping guard on the carpark late into the night. 

There were many holiday makers staying at the inn, en route to the Black Sea or heading home again. We spoke to a couple of girls who wanted to practice their English. Having talked with us for about an hour we asked them to join our table, as we had been talking across the room. They declined saying, “Our husbands are ‘Business Men’. They would not like it.” They went on to explain that their families, including several children, were catching a couple of hours sleep before driving on to the coast. They had ‘big cars’, Audis, and had driven down from the Urals in one day. Tired, we retreated to our communal room which we shared with a few cockroaches.  
The following morning, Sunday 29th, we drove a few miles together, shared a final breakfast and then it was time to say goodbye to the Austrians. They were continuing on through Russia while we were heading to the border. It only took us a few minutes to appreciate how much we’d enjoyed travelling with them and felt only regret that they were to make their own way via Russia and not rough it with us through Eastern Kazakhstan.

Soon our attention was drawn back to navigation. Confident we were heading in the right direction but without a map or a relative understanding of where we were, we carried on in good faith. Running out of tarmac we hit a single track road ducking and diving through a sunflower field. A friendly farmer assured us that the main road into Kazakhstan was straight ahead about 20km. The sunflowers gave way to wild grass, prairie or steppe, with herds of horses, steppe eagles and a glimpse of our first camel.

As promised, we soon met the main road and continued down to the border. Having had a bit of a tussle getting into the Ukraine and then been forced to pay a bribe on leaving, we had expected the Kazakh border control to be at least as difficult. However, we crossed unhindered and relatively quickly. With another useless but compulsory insurance policy and a couple of complimentary water melons, we were free to hit the 100km of tarmac. Far short of Oral, our intended destination, the road became too dangerous for night driving. We camped up for our first night in the wild &#8211; with the fullest complement of stars yet &#8211; the whole of the heavens visible until meeting the flatness of the steppe.
