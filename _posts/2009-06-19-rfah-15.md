## 15<sup>th</sup> August, A Desert Somewhere in Outer Mongolia

We had all agreed that if there were any more problems with our car, then the others must press on, as time was slipping away and it was no fun hanging around for each other. It was a promising morning with the sun coming up over the lake. We rolled our car across the pebbles and bumped it on its way. Everything went fine to begin with and we drove on for some distance before Jonno felt it hicup and lurch again. We just waved for the others to carry on as it seemed more appropriate than them stopping to say goodbye. 

As they disappeared over the horizon we plodded on at 20km per hour. It was a strange time for us both, not knowing of anything better to do we just rolled on. One of us would have to get out and run while we went up hills as we had lost so much power. We joked about continuing in this way, night and day, until we got to the capital but in the end we crunched to a halt just after a huge ghur which passed for a roadside stop.

The situation was close to desperate. The ghur had various cranes and broken trucks around it. It must have been a post for the road building navvies. We pushed the car back down the dusty hill to the ghur. Someone had hung a sheep from a wire on the crane and was tearing off its skin. We just sat in the car for a while and tried to let it all sink in. 

I reassured Jonno, “It’s okay mate, we’re not gunna die here, we’ve plenty of water and there are people around.”  
Jonno gasped. The thought of death had seemingly never crossed his mind.

I was ready to just abandon the car, take what I wanted and hitch to the finish. I had lost all heart in it and the £400 penalty for abandoning the car was not weighing too heavily on me. Jonno on the other hand felt it his manifest destiny to drag the car to the finish line. He said he needed his £200 share of the fine to support himself through a trip to China, planned immediately after the Rally, but I think there was more to it than that. And so, because Jonno is as stubborn as the day is long, we had to get us and our car out of the middle of nowhere and proceed a further 1000km across a freezing, barren plain to the finish line.

I went for a wash in the little brook we had just crossed as I thought it important to have a little break, a shave and a change of clothes. A couple of camels stood a skip away up stream. They ignored me as I had a wash and boiled some water for a shave. When I got back Jonno had stopped a couple of passing cars and wagons, asking for a tow. Nobody agreed to tow us but everyone had offered us a lift. Very soon afterwards an old Soviet 4WD pulled up. Some Mongolian engineers got out and offered help. In hindsight I wish I had given them a chance but I had given up.

We had tried everything and leaving the relative security of the roadside stop, in a car I was convinced had died, was too much. I could not face such an attempt without a few days rest and a restored confidence in our dear old Amélie. It was a shame to turn down the Mongolian engineers but the Medics from the previous day had arrived and offered us a tow to the Transsyberian Rally camp in Altai, some 300km away. They were sure that from there we would be able to get some mechanical help or be able to arrange passage on the back of a wagon. 

It was an incredible relief to be rescued by a team of highly intelligent, well-equipped and generous Europeans. No matter how friendly and good the locals were, language and customs were a persistent barrier and we were tired and far from home. However, it was not over yet. Altai was some distance away and we would be travelling at a new and increased top speed of 50km per hour. I’m quite sure Klaus, the owner of the business was not entirely happy with the arrangement. As he put the expensive looking elastic tow rope onto our now worthless and ruined car I could see he was not looking forward to towing us for the next five or more hours, until well after dark, to save us £400. 

It didn’t take long for stones thrown up from their rear wheels to crack our windscreen. Fortunately it didn’t completely shatter but every time we saw a fist sized rock lift off and sail towards us, there was little we could do but watch and hope. The dust was nearly blinding and I wrapped a jumper around my head and mouth to offer myself some protection. Jonno found the experience terrifying, and was unable to take a turn at driving. He was keen to tell them to slow down but I did not want to irritate them too much incase they would tire of the affair and abandon us and our car.

We had taped up the entire window apart from an area the size of an envelope for me to look through and even that was quickly cracked and covered in dust. Periodically I had to lean out of the window with a bottle of water and a broken window wiper to keep it clean. Dan had given us a radio to communicate with them. He regularly checked that we were okay and we used it to tell him when the rope had come loose or when it had become wrapped around one of the drive shafts. Whenever we went over a sand dune we did so at 50km per hour which made it easier for the towing vehicle. We would fly up, all four wheels in the air. When we landed, the rope would be slack and we would be catapulted forward as it tightened, something quite dangerous in a 2CV as there are no head rests and our necks would get a nasty shock at every tug of the rope. Another of Klaus’s ambulances arrived. They videoed us being towed and said our car was ‘a brave duck’. It certainly was. By the time we got to the Porsche camp, a wing had been ripped off, the antennae-like headlights had been destroyed as had the grill and the fan. The remainder of the front of the car had also fared badly from the sandblasting it had experienced. Nevertheless it held out.

We were all exhausted and glad to get a bit of German food &#8211; roast beef, pickled gherkins, the lot. Dan gave us a pair of jackets. The atmosphere around camp was subdued. One of the drivers had been seriously injured, breaking his back during the day’s race, his co-driver had also been hurt. We met a man who explained he should have been in the car but he had passed up on it, feeling ill, and offered his place to a man who was not racing because he had written off his own car. He was obviously very emotional about it but was kind to us and gave Jonno his mate’s tent and a roll mat. Another lost soul gave a temporary windshield ‘incase we got the car running again’.
