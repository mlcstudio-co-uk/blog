The profile of this railing top is designed to be leaned on while looking out to sea.  It has a near flat section for sitting a drink on and a curved end for a satisfying hold.  Rods were favoured over glass panels as windblown salt would make demands upon the owner for regular cleaning.  However this decision will be reviewed to bring the design in line with local codes of safety.

The original site that inspired the design for this railing was a patio on a property at Shore Acres in Sidney, just north of Victoria, Vancouver Island, Canada.
