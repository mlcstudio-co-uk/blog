## 13<sup>th</sup> August, Tolobo – Hovd

It was very important for us to make up some ground after our unimpressive progress the previous day. However, we were just past Tolobo when Jonno noticed a problem with the back end. We all stopped and inspected. The rear offside was riding very low, apparently on the shocks as the suspension had become defunct. Rupert diagnosed the problem. The suspension had broken one of its couplings. We found what was left of the broken bolt and started trying to re-couple the tie rod. However we tried, we could not get the rod close enough to the bracket. The rod should be extendable but due to the years of rust it wouldn’t budge, no matter how much levering or hammering went on. We tried jacking up wheels front and back to loosen the system and get the tie-rod just another inch closer, but to no avail. 

Rupert had a spare tie-rod so we were resigning ourselves to having to replace the part, when a Lada pulled up with a family of perfectly eccentric looking Mongolians. The driver was wearing a fetching purple woolly jumper under a sheepskin coat, accessorized with tinted shades and a woolly hat. It was decidedly cold and our hands soon became numb. The driver pulled out an oil cloth full of parts and tools and Rupert set to work cutting a piece of rubber to fit inside the end of the tie-rod so that if we ever got a bolt through, it would last more than 100 metres.  
Fortunately, among the driver’s tools was a huge pair of mole grips, about two feet long, with a murderous bite. With these we managed to break the rust and extend the tie-rod. It was plain sailing from there and with a new bolt from our man and Rupert’s rubber disk I dared to say it was as good as new. Not a bodge but a delicate engineering operation.

It was soon lunchtime and we had gone a hopeless distance having been stopped for three hours fixing the car. The light did not seem to last till very late here either so we got going again. The road got jagged and rocky as we climbed another pass. It was much less steep than the previous pass but had been cut from the living rock making it brutal on the undercarriage, particularly on the heavier Fiesta. Several Porsches were towed past us; one support vehicle was towing two Cayennes. The dust, cold and the general severity of the conditions on this leg were tiring and oppressive. By the top of the pass ‘Team Moon Unit Alpha’ were gushing a steady stream of petrol. We tried to fix it with putty tape, duck tape, anything. All we succeeded in doing was getting very cold with hands dried white from the petrol drenching. We resolved to push on and get it fixed at Hovd. 

However, we stopped for the evening just short of the town when the Fiesta ran out of fuel. We tried again, but alas unsuccessfully, to fix the Fiesta. Jonno favoured using a piece of metal plate, a spacer from our door catch. I favoured a piece of Jonno’s pyjama trousers saturated with epoxy resin. In the end I tried with the fabric but it was badly fitted and left mostly unglued. Instead of lying down at the opposite side to block the freezing wind that was channelling sand into my eyes Jonno simply stood around telling me it would never work. Understandably I couldn’t be bothered to mix a second batch of glue and the job was left unfinished. Efforts to run the Fiesta off a jerry can were also foiled. It required a fuel pump to maintain sufficient pressure but it was unaccessible, concealed behind the various guards and underbellies.

Once we had given up for the evening we prepared a pile of brush and dry grass to burn, made supper and then, once the sun had set, we began to get drunk. The party lasted a bit longer with a fire to keep us entertained between stories and rounds. We soon finished Jim’s superior vodka and started on a bottle that Adam had bought. He had chosen it especially because it came in a pretty bottle. Indeed it could have been mistaken for an enlarged perfume bottle and the foul contents for perfume solvent. However, we did manage to enjoy it – all of it. It was a great evening. We had a kerosene fed gorse fire with a petrol tank wind shield, travel stories and some flashing vodka shot glasses.
